        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Although widely associated with Indian cuisine, Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq and as far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls home has resulted in a wide variety of preparations and ingredients; however, it is typically prepared by layering seasoned chicken with rice and aromatics and steaming them together.</p>
        <ul type="discs">
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>10 grams garlic (grated)</li>
            <li>10 grams ginger (grated)</li>
            <li>1 serrano chili peppers (to taste, minced)</li>
            <li>5 grams mint (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>10 grams cilantro (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>900 grams bone-in skin-on chicken thighs (or drumsticks)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint, cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and toss together making sure the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>To par-boil the rice, add the water, salt, cardamom, cumin and bay leaf to a pot and bring to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 7 minutes. Drain the rice, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
            <li>In the pot you caramelized the onions in, add the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down. Fry until golden brown on one side (about 5 minutes). Flip the chicken over and fry the other side until golden brown. Transfer the chicken back to the bowl you marinated it in.</li>
            <li>To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice mixture to the bottom of the pot you browned the chicken in.</li>
        </ol>
